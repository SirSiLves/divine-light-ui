	"features.howto.explain": "Divine-Light is a chess-like strategy game but with rays of light. Each player alternately draws one of their pawns. The figures may only be moved 1 space at a time. A move also counts if the figure is rotated by 90 °, for example. At the end of each turn, your own light beam will be activated. If the light beam hits a pawn on a non-mirrored side, it is removed from the game. This also applies if your own beam of light hits your own figure. If the light beam hits the king, the game is won or lost for the other player.",
	"features.howto.figure1": "The two reflector figures have a mirror on both sides. They reflect rays from all sides, deflect it by 90 degrees and cannot be hit.",
	"features.howto.figure2": "However, they can also be useful for the enemy. The reflectors are the only ones allowed to exchange places with certain directly adjacent figures of both colors.",
